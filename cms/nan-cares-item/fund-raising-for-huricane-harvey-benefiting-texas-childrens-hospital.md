  When Hurricane Harvey struck our city, Nan and Company Properties created an
  online fundraiser to help aid the patients, employees, and families of Texas
  Childrens Hospital. During the storm, the pediatric hospital had over 600
  patients and over 2000 employees in its care, many of who did not have a home
  to return to in the aftermath. Thousands of patient's families and employees
  outside of the hospital were also severely impacted from the storm.|The
  #nanfam joined forces, and several generous people of our Houston community
  came together to donate to our campaign. We are proud to say that on November
  28th, our firm was able to present Texas Childrens Hospital with $10,000 in
  funds raised. Thank you to all who contributed; your donations have gone to an
  amazing cause. Another special thank you to Texas Childrens Hospital. Words
  cannot sufficiently express how much we appreciate all that you do! We hope
  these funds will provide great relief. Nan and Company Properties is the
  leading luxury real estate firm in Houston, TX and the exclusive Houston
  affiliate of Christie's International Real Estate. Looking to buy, sell, or
