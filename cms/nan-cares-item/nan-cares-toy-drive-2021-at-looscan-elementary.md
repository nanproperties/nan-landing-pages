  With the help of 3 Men Movers, Nan and Company Properties transported bundles
  of toys that were collected by our team members for the students of Looscan
  Elementary during our annual Nan Cares Toy Drive. Looscan Elementary houses
  Pre-K through fifth grade and is located in the Independence Heights area of
  Houston. Our #nanfam was able to ensure that every single student of the
  school received a toy for the holiday season.
