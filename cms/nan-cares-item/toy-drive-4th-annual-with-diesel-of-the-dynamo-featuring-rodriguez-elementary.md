  1,000 toys for 1,000 kids?? Yes, you heard right! Nan and Company Properties
  took the season of giving to new highs this year. We provided the lovely
  children of Rodriguez Elementary with amazing toys for Christmas! No child was
  left out of the fun this year and we couldnt wait to see the joy on their
  super cute faces! With our admin staff on hand, we collected, organized, and
  distributed all the toys our generous community was able to help us collect.
  But the season of giving doesnt end here, subscribe to our YouTube channel in
  order to see how else our #NANFAM is giving back to the community.
