  At Brookline Elementary in Houston, statistics show that 98% of the students
  are considered economically disadvantaged, while 85% are high risk. Outside of
  this school alone, there are thousands of other children within families in
  Houston that are economically disadvantaged.This unfortunate reality is what
  motivated us to start our first annual "Nan Cares Toy Drive." We want to
  continue providing children such as the students at Brookline Elementary with
  toys every year so that they can enjoy the holiday season, regardless of their
  financial circumstances.|Nan and Company Properties presented our first annual
  Nan Cares Toy Drive this past Tuesday, December 13th at Brookline Elementary,
  to give away all of our collected toys and books to each and every student.
  Much to their surprise, Astros all-star, Jose Altuve, even came out to help us
  pass out toys! The best part about the toy drive was seeing the bright and
  excited smiles on all of the childrens faces as they received their very own
  toy and book.|Our first Nan Cares Toy Drive even made the news! Channel 11 and
  Fox 26 came out to join us as we brightened the childrens day at Brookline
  Elementary and interviewed Altuve and our Nan and Company Properties president
  and CEO, Nancy Almodovar.|But, this toy drive could not have happened without
  you. This year, we were able to successfully gather 1000 toys and 1000 books
  through donations from all around the community and were able to give away all
  of our donations to these children in need. Because of that, we would like to
  thank our Nan and Company Properties team and everyone else who helped and
  worked hard to make this amazing day happen, from our volunteers to members of
  the community who donated to this wonderful cause.
