  The south was hit with a massive winter storm that caused millions to lose
  power and water and saw damage to infrastructure and homes. To give back to
  our hometown, Houston, TX, Nan and Company Properties partnered with various
  businesses to provide food to Houstonians impacted by the winter storm.
