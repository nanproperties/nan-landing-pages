  Driven by the idea that not every child in Houston will be fortunate enough to
  open a gift this holiday season, Nan and Company Properties started the Nan
  Cares Toy Drive three years ago to benefit the students of Houston's
  underprivileged elementary schools.|This year, Nan Cares Toy Drive established
  a goal of collecting toys to benefit Bussey Elementary, where 94 percent of
  its students are economically disadvantaged. Ninety-six percent are of Latino
  ethnicity. Together with the help of its team, industry partners, clients and
  other members of the Houston community, Nan and Company Properties/Christie's
  International Real Estate collected 1,000 toys to donate to Bussey Elementary!
  This past week after much anticipation, the students of Bussey Elementary were
  finally able to receive their gifts, and they couldn't have been more excited!
  Watch the video below for an inside look!
