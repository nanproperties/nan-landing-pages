f_things-to-do-1-headline: Explore The Baths at Virgin Gorda
f_things-to-do-1-description: >-
  Wading through the colorful coves and granite boulders of The Baths in Virgin
  Gorda is undeniably the most notable experience you can have in the British
  Virgin Islands. Travelers and experts alike agree: It's the must-see
  attraction of the BVI archipelago. Massive smooth ash gray boulders of varying
  sizes rise from the sea's crystalline waters, making a maze of sorts for
  travelers to wade or swim through. Climbing through the crevices and grottoes
  of The Baths isn't terribly intensive, but the granite boulders can be
  slippery so swim shoes or sneakers are encouraged. Once you reach Devil's Bay,
  the stunning beach clearing at the end of the rocks, you'll find shallow clear
  waters perfect for a little light snorkeling or restful sunbathing. Visitors
  are consistent in their praise of The Baths, calling the natural wonder
  "beautiful" and the beach "pristine."  Although photo opportunities are rife
  at The Baths, some travelers recommend saving space on your camera for a few
  shots of The Baths' Cathedral Room – a natural pool within a small cave.

  The British Virgin Islands are every water sports enthusiast's dream.
  Surrounded by miles of brilliant blue, crystal clear Caribbean Sea, the
  islands are truly best explored on the water. Many travelers choose to island
  hop on a catamaran, sailboat or yacht – whether for a daytrip or a weeklong
  adventure – while others may simply be interested in kayaking and
  paddleboarding through the calm water in shallower depths off the coast of
  their resort or nearest beach. No matter what appeals to you, you should plan
  to spend at least some time in the BVI out on the water.

  The RMS Rhone is one of the premier shipwrecks to explore. The vessel sailed
  for the last time on Oct. 19, 1867, and sank near Salt Island during a
  Category 3 hurricane. Now, the site of the wreck and its surrounding waters
  are known as the Rhone National Marine Park (the sole park of its kind in the
  British Virgin Islands) and it's a go-to dive for intermediate to advanced
  divers, though there are sections that beginners can enjoy as well. \nYou can
  spot the ship's bow from the surface of the sea, but you'll have to dive some
  90 feet down to explore the rest of the largely intact vessel and swim among
  the moray eels, turtles and octopus that now call the ship home. Several
  divers were in awe of how much of the vessel is still intact, with even
  experienced scuba pros saying it's the best dive they've done. Others say that
  the experience was almost eerie, especially for travelers that read about the
  sinking of the ship prior to their dive.
