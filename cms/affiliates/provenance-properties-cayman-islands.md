  This bustling Town Centre is a must-visit in the Grand Cayman community. As a
  place to work, dine, and play, Camana Bay is home to a myriad of top business
  establishments, diverse restaurants, and designer shops. Among the many events
  held annually, Camana Bay hosts weekly events such as a local farmers market
  on Wednesdays, the acclaimed Flavour Tour where foodies can experience various
  dishes and paired cocktails on a guided culinary tour of the Town’s signature
  restaurants and, on the weekends, catch a Hollywood blockbuster at the
  island’s only cinema, Camana Bay Cinema, or splash about in the harbourfront
  fountains.

  As the culinary capital of the Caribbean, the Cayman Islands offers endless
  dining options, not to mention being spoiled for choice when it comes to
  seafood. Be sure to try conch, a popular dish on the island, which can be
  prepared many different ways from stewed, deep fried and dunked in jerk sauce,
  or caught fresh for a ceviche. For more on the dining scene, read this guide
  to the top 10 restaurants to try when living in Grand Cayman.

  From novice to advanced, those who love to golf can find the only 18-hole
  championship golf course in the Cayman Islands at North Sound Golf Club. At
  the Ritz-Carlton, Grand Cayman, golf enthusiasts enjoy a nine-hole course
  designed by Greg Norman. Whichever course you choose, you will experience lush
  tropical landscapes complete with sunbathing iguanas and distracting water
  views.
