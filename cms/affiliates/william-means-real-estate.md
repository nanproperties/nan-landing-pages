  To get a better view of the Charleston harbor (and maybe even spot some
  dolphins), consider signing up for a boat tour. Not only will you enjoy some
  time on the water, you'll also have the chance to learn more about the city's
  maritime history (many boat captains provide historical commentary throughout
  their tours). Along the way, you'll likely see some of Charleston's top
  landmarks, including The Battery, Waterfront Park, the Arthur Ravenel Jr.
  Bridge, Fort Sumter and Castle Pinckney.

  With its centuries-old mansion and cobblestone streets, Charleston is like a
  living museum. One of the best ways to learn about its history (and its
  ghosts) as well as the significance of its best-known landmarks is on a
  walking tour. There are a variety of options available, ranging from broad
  tours of the city's historic downtown district, to more niche tours that
  explore the city's paranormal presence, pirates and art galleries and studios.

  You probably remember Fort Sumter as the place where the first shot of the
  Civil War was fired, back in 1861. Today, you can see for yourself where all
  the action happened by taking a ferry to the actual fort. Take your time
  exploring the thick stone caverns, which still house several Civil War-era
  cannons. You should also stop by Fort Sumter's small yet informative museum,
  which provides more in-depth information about the fort's role in the war.
  According to most Charleston visitors, Fort Sumter is a must-see, especially
  for kids and history buffs.
