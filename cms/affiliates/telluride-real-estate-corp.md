  Scenic and gravity defying, our public transportation is like a gentle
  amusement ride. With 360 degree views of breathtaking scenery, the 13 minute
  commute from downtown Telluride takes you to European inspired Mountain
  Village.

  Last year, the Telluride Golf club expanded its game improvement platform with
  an entire new 55,000 square foot golf practice facility. This includes a
  350-yard long hitting area with three 100-yard wide tee boxes, plus a new
  chipping area and putting green of 7,900 square feet. At the ski resort,
  Telluride’s green circles, groomed blues and gourmet powder can be found at
  every turn. Overall, nearly 60% of Telluride’s terrain is beginner or
  intermediate, but lift lines and crowded slopes seem like a million miles
  away. Visiting Telluride is all about going your own way, leaving the pack
  behind, and skiing a mecca few are lucky enough to enjoy.
