  Quarton Lake, located on the city’s west side, is fed by the Rouge River. The
  Quarton Lake Park surrounds the lake almost entirely and provides passive
  recreation areas for the public. In the fall of 2005, improvements to the park
  were completed. This restoration project included: dredging of sediment,
  removal of invasive species, shoreline stabilization, creation of a fish
  habitat, and an assessment of the tributary stream corridor.

  The Detroit Zoo has 125 acres of naturalistic habitats for more than 2,000
  animals, from all across the globe. A visit to the African Rainforest is home
  to several species of must-see African natives, including the residents of the
  Great Apes of Harambee – chimpanzees, gorillas and a drill – and birds such as
  cranes, flamingos, spoonbills and vultures. The African Grasslands is where
  kids can learn about the diverse species of the vast African Savannah,
  including Warthogs, giraffes, Grevy’s zebras, white rhinoceroses, lions,
  African birds and aardvarks.
