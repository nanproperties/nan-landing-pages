  Trolley Pub is a BYOB, pedal-powered, eco-friendly, pub-crawling pedal bar for
  up to 14 people at a time. The Trolley Pub is powered by you and your fellow
  pedalers, with an electric assist motor for the hills. If you don’t have
  enough people for a full beer bike tour, or you prefer to socialize with other
  people, you can purchase Mixer Tickets (individual seats). All Charlotte Mixer
  Tours are in Uptown and make two to three stops (15-20 minute each) along the
  way. Your driver will customize the route each time based on the riders and
  requests!

Founder Lori Ivester Jackson began selling real estate in Charlotte’s emerging Dilworth neighborhood in the mid-1980s and has gone on to become one of the region’s most recognized residential property experts. After a long tenure as one of Remax’s top producing teams in the Carolinas, Lori formed Ivester Jackson in the late 1990s with former corporate executive and husband, Reed Jackson, whose career in advertising and operations helped form the foundation for what has become one of the region’s most successful boutique real estate firms. After attracting a roster of some of the region’s most preeminent brokers, the company was approached by multiple leading international luxury real estate brands to represent their clientele in the Carolinas. In late 2013, the company affiliated with luxury leader Christie’s International Real Estate, a partnership that has seen the company triple its revenues and expand to five offices with over 90 brokers. In 2017, Ivester Jackson was awarded the Christie’s International Affiliate of the Year award for its excellence in global business innovation, market leadership, and advertising expertise among 145 of Christie’s elite brokerages around the world.
