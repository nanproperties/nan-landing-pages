  The Underwater Museum of Art is the first permanent underwater sculpture
  garden in the U.S. Located in the Gulf of Mexico, off of Walton County,
  Florida, the museum lies at a depth of approximately 58-feet and at a distance
  of .7-miles from the shore of Grayton Beach State Park. The coordinates for
  the center sculpture (SWARA Skull) are Latitude N 30 18.754 Longitude W 86
  09.522. Out of respect for the art, boaters are asked to find the center
  location and then move away from the park to anchor in order to avoid damage
  to the artwork.
