  Located just 25 miles away from Kalispell is the world-famous ski resort,
  Whitefish Mountain. This is perfect for those who love to ski, snowboard, or
  just enjoy being around the slopes! This goes for wintertime, of course, but
  summertime is a fun time to visit, too. Some of the summer activities at
  Whitefish Mountain Resort include ziplines, alpine slides, mountain biking,
  and a strider bike park just for kids who love their pedal-less strider bikes!
  This place provides year round fun for the whole family.

  This is the perfect event for all history lovers. In 1892, Charles Conrad
  founded the town of Kalispell and together with his wife Lettie, built their
  dream home in the backdrop of the Montana wilderness. The mansion is 13,000
  square feet and sits on roughly three acres. The acreage is beautifully
  landscaped and still boasts some of its original features such as dry stone
  fencing. This one-hour tour is well worth it!
