  If it's in Texas, it must be bigger and better. That is the motto that
  architects followed with the Capitol Building in Austin. At one time, it was
  the tallest capitol building in the nation. Others might be taller now, but
  this is still a beautiful building that shows off many of the natural
  resources which are so prevalent in Texas, such as limestone and the
  landscapes.

In 1986, after eight years of experience in the real estate industry, founder Emily Moreland decided it was time to open her own brokerage firm. She always imagined a company that held the standards of professionalism, ethics, integrity, dependability, commitment and hard work as high as she did. She wanted a company that built relationships and gave back to the community. She wanted a company that loved the Austin area as much as she did (and still does).\\n\\nFour years later that company officially became Moreland Properties. Since those early beginnings, Moreland has sustained a pattern of solid growth, going from two agents in one location to over 75 agents in three locations. Referrals and repeat business from satisfied clients has fueled this rapid growth. Although Emily still plays an integral role in the day-to-day operations of the business, most of her time is spent supporting her agents and their clients' needs.
