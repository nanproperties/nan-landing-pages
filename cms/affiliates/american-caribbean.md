  What better way to explore the gorgeous waters of Key Largo than to take a
  ride on a glass bottom boat! The Key Largo Princess is a luxurious 75-foot,
  140-passenger, glass bottom aluminum motor yacht which allows you to enjoy a 
  45-minute voyage out to the reef. It gives you time to relax on the sun deck
  and sip a tropical cocktail or beverage from their full-service snack bar. \n

  Established in 1963, John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park was the first
  undersea park in the United States. John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, and
  the adjacent Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, cover approximately 178
  nautical square miles of coral reefs, seagrass beds and mangrove swamps. The
  park extends 3 miles into the Atlantic Ocean and is approximately 25 miles in
  length. These areas were established to protect and preserve a portion of the
  only living coral reef in the continental United States. The park was added to
  the National Register of Historic Places on April 14, 1972.\n
