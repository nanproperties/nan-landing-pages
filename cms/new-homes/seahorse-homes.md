  Discover the ultimate beachfront living at Seahorse Estates, the most
  luxurious beachfront community on Follet’s Island, and The Best Kept Secret on
  the Texas Gulf Coast. Don’t settle for a cramped old beach house with limited
  views and inadequate amenities. Instead, build your dream beach house on one
  of the most spectacular properties on the Gulf Coast and enjoy panoramic Gulf
  and Bay views any day you choose. Seahorse Estates offers only two waterfront
  rows of homes, beachfront or bayfront, ensuring that all residents have
  unparalleled views of both the gulf and bay. We are located in the
  unincorporated portion of Follet’s Island which means Brazoria County
  maintains our pristine beaches with a regular maintenance schedule and they
  still allow for fireworks and campfires. Our developer, John Howton, put a
  portion of Seahorse Estates into conservation and helped to establish the Drum
  Bay Nature Preserve into what it is today, ensuring that residents will always
  have access to incredible bay views and that migratory birds will always have
  a place to rest on their journey. While most of the coast faces beach erosion,
  our beaches are stable and naturally growing and our community offers direct
  access to both the beach and bay with beach and bay community amenities that
  are second to none. Enjoy convenient access to a family-friendly beach via one
  of seven beach walkovers and to Drum Bay via a community boardwalk that stops
  off at a charming crabbing pier and a fishing pier with kayak launch access
  directly into the Christmas Bay System. In addition, Seahorse Estates has
  plans for even more community amenities, including a 9-hole putt-putt golf
  course, playground and picnic pavilion. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to
  own a piece of paradise at Seahorse Estates.
