  Welcome to this stunning new construction by Lion Homes. You will be taken
  aback by the beauty of this home - boasting a double coffered ceiling in the
  living area with surround sound, open shelving in the kitchen with an
  abundance of elegant, white, soft close, shaker cabinets and soft close
  drawers, a stainless farm sink and a 5 burner, high end gas cooktop/oven
  complete with a pot filler. The white, Carrera marble countertops are a smart
  contrast to the colored cabinets on the island with matching cabinets in the
  bathrooms. This home offers an en-suite for your guest or favorite child ;).
  The primary suite offers a stately, coffered ceiling, a soaker tub, separate
  his/her sinks, and a shower you wont want to get out of until the hot water
  runs plum out! And just incase you want to listen to your favorite playlist,
  the primary bedroom is ready to accomodate - equipped with it own personal
  surround sound with bluetooth capabilities that are completely separate from
  the living room.
