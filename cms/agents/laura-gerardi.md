  Laura Gerardi has been in the real estate industry for over half a decade.
  What motivated her to get into the industry was the interaction she and her
  husband had with a listing agent when they decided to buy a home. The
  relationship she formed with the agent showed Laura the true impact a Realtor
  can have on their clients. Laura has been helping people find their dream home
  ever since! Her extensive background in management and sales has helped equip
  her with unparalleled hospitality skills and customer service. The hard work,
  diligence, and professional networking skills Laura used in her sales career
  still lends itself useful when it comes to marketing her sellers homes and
  partnering with buyers to exceed their needs and expectations. The best part
  of her job is being able to guide her clients through the real estate process
  and assisting in making their goals become a reality. If Laura can play a role
  in making the home buying or selling experience seamless and enjoyable, thatâ€™s
  a huge win in her book. Her extreme attention to detail and service-oriented
  nature differentiates her from other Realtors in the industry. A Houston
  native, Laura loves how the city is so diverse and encourages different
  lifestyles. She truly believes there is something for everyone here. When not
  with clients, Laura can be found enjoying quality time at Frostwood Park with
  her kids. She also loves entertaining alongside her chef husband in their new
  neighborhood in Bunker Hill Village. Laura specializes in the Galleria and
  Memorial areas but provides her clients with exceptional service at an
  elevated level all over Houston. For a meticulous, hardworking agent you can
  trust, call Laura Gerardi today.
