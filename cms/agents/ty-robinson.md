  Ty Robinson is a native Houstonian who holds a Bachelor of Arts in Political
  Science

  from Prairie View A&M and a Master’s in Community Development from Prairie
  View

  A&M University’s College of Architecture. Ty is a top producing agent who has
  led an

  extensive professional career prior to her real estate endeavors. Her love for
  real estate

  and development began while studying in her master’s program. It was during
  this time

  that she felt inspired by her college professors who influenced her to take
  the first steps

  in getting her real estate license. They encouraged her to seek jobs in the
  development

  space in the process of her becoming a real estate agent. Heading their
  advice, Ty

  landed a position with McGregor Area Community Development where she was

  presented the opportunity to further learn how development and being a
  licensed real

  estate agent would go hand in hand.

  While working in community development for the McGregor area CDC, Ty focused
  on

  the redevelopment efforts of The Greater 3rd Ward community. One of her main
  focuses

  during this time was to bridge the gaps between the development community and
  the

  community stakeholders. While pushing these goals forward, Ty was then
  recruited to

  step into the educational world by joining Yes Prep North Forest as a founding
  staff

  member. Here she oversaw campus operations for four years as the Director of

  Operations. During her tenure, she discovered her love for community, and the

  importance of home ownership. It was this journey that influenced Ty to focus
  on

  making a greater change in her community by going into corporate sales. It was
  during

  this time that she started to sell to school districts and public entities by
  providing

  students across the great state of Texas healthy food options. Ty found this
  work to be incredibly rewarding and took great pride in the educational

  aspects and community building. After a year and a half in this role, she then
  decided it

  was time to leverage all of her accomplishments and results-oriented drive
  into her own

  business.

  In March 2018 Ty decided to focus all of her skills and tool sets learned from
  her time in

  corporate America to real estate. Since this time, Ty has grown into a
  powerful leader

  who leverages analytics to solve problems, think strategically, quickly devise
  action

  plans, and forge partnerships to achieve goals. Ty is a well-rounded
  professional, with

  an exceptional blend of experiences in public and private organizations, who
  blends her

  operational ability with front-line sales perspective.

  Ty's commitment to her clients is to help them best transition into a new
  place as

  smoothly as possible. She is known for her sincerity, honesty, and straight
  forward

  approach by professional peers. As a consistent driver of results, she has
  demonstrated

  the ability to meet the demands of each client regardless of their real estate
  needs. In her spare time, Ty enjoys spending time with her friends and family
  and exploring the

  different areas of Houston. Whether one is looking to buy or sell, Ty Robinson
  is a

  trustworthy, reliable and genuine realtor who takes pride in going the extra
  mile to help

  her clients achieve their goals and actively researches the market to stay on
  top of the best details of the city.
