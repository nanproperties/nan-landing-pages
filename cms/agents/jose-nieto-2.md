  Jose Nieto's background is rooted in luxury and ambition. Raised in the
  affluent suburb of Spring, Texas by parents who immigrated from Mexico, Jose
  was driven to succeed in real estate from a young age. He was determined to be
  his own boss and to embody the leadership qualities he felt were lacking in
  the industry. After receiving a fortuitous recommendation from a customer who
  worked as an agent, Jose attended an industry event hosted by his friend Joe.
  He took the leap into real estate and, with his family-instilled work ethic,
  people skills, and general savvy, overcame the challenges of transitioning
  into a new field. As a self-made real estate mogul, Jose developed his
  business organically by networking and exploring the Texas market. He
  specializes in working with first-time homebuyers and providing down-payment
  assistance. Jose attributes much of his success to his bilingualism and
  willingness to travel, having sold homes all throughout Houston, as well as in
  surrounding areas such as Beaumont and Austin. Jose's business is entirely
  referral-based, a testament to the quality of his service. He takes pride in
  creating a joyful experience for each client, founded upon integrity and his
  process-driven posture. His communication skills are unparalleled, ensuring
  that clients are never left in the dark. Jose Nieto's exceptional service has
  been recognized by Houston's Real Producers, who named him one of the top 40
  under 40. He has also received a certificate of special recognition from
  Congresswoman Sylvia Garcia for his hard work and dedication. In pursuit of
  continued growth, Jose leads a team of three at his firm. His team allows him
  to expand his business while ensuring that clients always receive the
  high-quality service they deserve. As a man with a passion for both his work
  and his community, Jose looks forward to exceeding his previous year's sales
  while making time for activities such as bike riding, yoga, and spending time
  in nature. He is committed to serving his clients with the utmost
  professionalism and luxury.
