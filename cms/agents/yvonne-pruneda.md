  Yvonne Pruneda joined Nan & Company Properties in 2015, bringing with her a
  wealth of business, investment and sales knowledge and experience. As a native
  Texan, her vast knowledge of the market is a valuable asset to the firm and
  its clients. After graduating from the University of Houston with a bachelor’s
  degree in business administration, Yvonne began her career in the insurance
  industry as an agent and producer. During her 10-year tenure in insurance, she
  excelled in sales in the property/casualty and life/health specialties. In
  2011, Yvonne moved from insurance to real estate, by taking a role as an
  assistant to a real estate broker. She learned the business first-hand from
  seasoned professionals, and eventually started serving her own clients as a
  realtor. In her first six months alone, she became a multi-million dollar
  producer, which set in motion her fast track to success. At Nan & Co., Yvonne
  takes great pride in helping clients see the investment opportunity real
  estate presents. As a real estate investor herself, she knows how to help
  clients make the most of every transaction. She enjoys educating buyers,
  seller and lessors about residential and commercial properties, making sure to
  address each client’s specific needs. In addition to her real estate
  knowledge, Yvonne is also bilingual (English and Spanish), and she has an eye
  for design, which she puts to use for property rehabilitation projects. When
  she’s not working to give clients her best service possible, she enjoys
  keeping fit through running, watching movies, dining out and spending time
  with her Shih Tzu, Paris.
