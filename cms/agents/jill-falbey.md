  Jill is a native Houstonian, raised by parents whose family business was real
  estate. She spent her formative years accompanying them viewing and acquiring
  properties, assisting with real estate appraisals, and performing accounting
  tasks. Her passion for real estate is inherited. In addition to her lifelong
  involvement with the real estate industry, Jill also has a love of
  architecture and interior design. She has had personal experience in
  purchasing, selling, renovating and remodeling numerous properties. Prior to
  becoming a residential real estate agent, Jill had a fulfilling 20-year career
  as an Intensive Care Unit Registered Nurse (RN) and Certified Registered Nurse
  Anesthetist (CRNA). Jill graduated from Baylor University with a Bachelor of
  Science in Nursing and a Minor in Business Administration. She then earned her
  Master of Science in Nurse Anesthesia with Highest Honors from Baylor College
  of Medicine. Obtaining her real estate license and joining Nan and Company
  Properties, Christie’s International Real Estate was a natural progression.
  This has enabled her to expand her professional network while continuing to do
  what she loves: helping others. Caring for her patients and attending to their
  needs is what Jill does best. These same principles apply to her clients in
  the real estate industry. “As an ICU nurse and CRNA, I felt much satisfaction
  from caring for and helping others,” said Jill. “Now I have a parallel goal –
  to help others with their real estate needs. I am detail-oriented which is not
  only vital in medicine, but it is very important in real estate as well.” Jill
  values grit, integrity, honesty and professionalism and brings those qualities
  to the real estate sector. She specializes in luxury real estate and is a West
  University Place market area specialist and resident. Jill’s free time is
  spent with her husband and three children at the Briar Club or at St. Anne’s
  Catholic Church, where they are parishioners. She enjoys volunteering for
  humanitarian causes, furthering her professional knowledge with continuing
  education courses, reading, and traveling with her family.
