Welcome to University Oaks, where comfort meets wellness.  

Imagine yourself living a life that is so healthy and restorative that it leaves you feeling refreshed and ready to take on anything. Imagine having access to all of the tools you need to make your dreams come true—and then some.  

University Oaks is a new collection of exceptional health and wellness focused residences with the highest quality finishes, top-of-the-line appliances and everything else you could possibly want. Nestled in one of Houston’s highest growth corridors, University Oaks is in close proximity to the University of Houston (UH), world-class Texas Medical Center, UH medical campus, Downtown Houston, Rice University, and the upcoming Texas A&M University complex—just to name a few!  

With modern finishes and elevated 10 ft ceilings throughout the entire building, you'll be able to live a lavish lifestyle without having to compromise on comfort or security. Our kitchens feature stainless steel appliances and in-unit washer and dryer. We also have large rooms and oversized windows that let in tons of natural light, making you feel like you're living in a resort instead of just another apartment complex.  

We believe that the best way to live is healthy. That's why we offer a 24/7 triple layer smart security system that includes a private garage, an interlocked security door, and interconnected smart home devices. Our homes are also built with Delos Healthy Home anti-COVID platform technology that monitors your home for environmental health risks at all times.  

If you're looking for a state of the art home with access to all of Houston's best amenities, including comfort and security, then look no further than University Oaks!
