  This adorable cottage is situated on a quaint street in the much sought after
  I'On neighborhood. Move into this two-bedroom charmer or take the opportunity
  to expand the home, which is located on a spacious, private and enclosed lot
  measuring over 6,500 sq. ft. The front porch welcomes you with French doors
  into what could be a cozy living room or use it as a downstairs bedroom with
  an en suite bath. The kitchen and dining/sitting area are located at the back
  of the home as well as a screened-in porch that overlooks the expansive
  backyard. Upstairs you'll find an additional bedroom with an en suite bath and
  a small office or den. The possibilities are endless for this home, which
  could support a large addition, renovation or rebuild. I'On is a much-coveted
  neighborhood close to downtown Charleston and has won numerous awards for its
  new urbanist design where you can walk to nearby lakes, restaurants and shops.
  A sports court, playground and community garden are located across the street
  and the I'On swimming and tennis club is just around the corner. Price is
  based on lot value alone.
