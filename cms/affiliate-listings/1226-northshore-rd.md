f_state: OR
f_list-price: $6,499,000
f_description: >-
  Listed at $6,499,000, this property is extra special because it is one of the
  best waterfront lots with 330 feet of shoreline and that includes a waterfront
  guest house! The main house is 5,608 sq. feet and the guest house, a luxury
  destination on your own property, is a fully self-contained 722 sq. feet -
  there is space here for everyone. Houses on Oswego Lake are often situated on
  really narrow lots, most with under 100 feet of shoreline, so this .61-acre
  lot with so much shoreline is really rare. In fact, this lot is one of the top
  10 largest on the lake. The courtyard is centered around a tiered water
  fountain that splashes and creates a peaceful echo off the surrounding stucco
  and stone walls. Wrought iron scrollwork and simple awnings decorate the
  timeless, terra cotta-hued exterior that is surrounded by lush green
  landscaping.
