  comfortably sleeps seventeen within six spacious bedrooms and bunkrooms.
  Expansive mountainous views from the great room explode at entry through
  floor-to ceiling windows spilling sunlight upon a two-and-a-half-story great
  room replete with a steel and glass fireplace. The open main level floorplan
  flows effortlessly to the dining area and a chef's kitchen with breakfast bar,
  concrete countertops, hand crafted cabinetry, upscale appliances, including
  built-in Miele coffee maker,
