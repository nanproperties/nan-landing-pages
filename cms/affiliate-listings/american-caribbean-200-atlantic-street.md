  Introducing Bunny Key, an extraordinary historic Islamorada oceanfront
  plantation. Once you enter the gate you will be entranced by the prettiest
  beach on the island of Islamorada with an estimated 240 feet lining the
  Atlantic ocean and lovely new dock. The main home and guest wing of 3 bedrooms
  radiate character at every corner, reminiscent of a time gone by with the
  inviting Old Florida porch stepping out onto the beach. The Kitchen is lined
  in custom Pecky Cypress cabinets and stone counters which blends beautifully
  with the Dade County pine flooring throughout. There is a historic 3 bedroom
  guest home and a 2 bedroom caretakers cottage on the sprawling grounds each
  with beautiful verandas featuring ocean vistas. Detached garage and outdoor
  kitchen area can also be found. This property is known by its provenance that
  starts as the LaBranche Fishing Camp in 1937, where it is said the owner and
  author penned many a fishing tale with the ocean as his muse and passion for
  fly fishing as his motivation. Wake up to the fish tailing and gentle waves
  along the shore with the palms swaying in the breeze. The sunrises are
  mesmerizing only to be rivaled by the evening sunsets and starry nights. This
  site of almost 2 prime acres is extraordinary and irreplaceable, truly meant
  to be cherished for the next generation of owners. This stunning estate is
  currently priced at $7,900,000. \n
