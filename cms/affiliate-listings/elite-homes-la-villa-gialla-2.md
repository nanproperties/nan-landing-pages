  Positioned on an exclusive parcel in the double-gated Marseilles South Shore
  neighborhood of Lake Las Vegas, La Villa Gialla is introduced to the market
  for the first time. Built in 2005, the Mediterranean-inspired estate is being
  offered by Elite Homes, the exclusive Las Vegas affiliate of Christie's
  International Real Estate. The estate's interiors are the work of celebrated
  designer Tony Grant of Las Vegas's award-winning Grant Design Group. The home
  boasts a variety of imported custom finishes throughout, including a
  main-level floor of ¾-inch-thick Jerusalem gold-hued natural stone imported
  from Italy. Many of the home's appointments are hand-made and custom-designed,
  including the entry door of hand-forged iron; a main staircase of hand-crafted
  balustrades and handrails; an imported dining-room table; a chandelier of
  hand-blown Murano glass imported from Italy; as well as a majority of its
  furnishings – including chairs, sofas, tables, and headboards. The furniture
  can be included in the sale.The three-level home, built on a cascading lot to
  optimize the views, is entered by a gated stone driveway from the fairway side
  of the property and is distinguished by its elegant aged-stone columns and
  arches. A generous living room and raised formal dining room are ideal for
  entertaining, complete with a modern chef's kitchen, butler's pantry and a
  lower level wine cellar, adjacent to the home theatre, offering storage for
  hundreds of bottles. No detail was spared in accommodating grandeur. Ornate
  crown molding, customized for each bedroom fill the property. A beautiful
  library and office space are also found on the main floor. All 3 levels of the
  home feature spacious laundry rooms and easy access to the elevator. The
  entire third floor of the home is devoted to the master suite, with an ornate
  aged-stone fireplace as the bedroom's centerpiece.
