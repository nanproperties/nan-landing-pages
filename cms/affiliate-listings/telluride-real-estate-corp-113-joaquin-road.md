f_description: >-
  The residence's architect, Hugh Newell Jacobsen, has a reputation for ''spaces
  that feel at once familiar and inventive.'' The architecture of this exquisite
  home is distinguished by the sparse detail of geometric, pavilion-like forms
  and simple roof lines that enhance the vibrant and comfortable spaces within.
  Situate on nearly 3 acres of lushly wooded property with end of the road
  privacy, the residence frames views of surrounding peaks and possesses warm
  solar exposure. The flow of the floor plan is both inviting and intriguing, as
  movement to each space creates new and exciting identities. Expansive patios
  and decking flow seamlessly to the exterior inviting its owner and guests to
  outdoor living spaces. A perfect mix of art and architecture.
