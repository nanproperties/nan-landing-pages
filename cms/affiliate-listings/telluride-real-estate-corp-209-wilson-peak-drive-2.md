  The Ultimate in Effortless Ski Access. The residence's sense of arrival
  presents architecture that is both uniquely contemporary with a blend of
  curvature and simplistic linear design that blends seamlessly with its
  mountainous environment through usage of copper and red Cedar siding and
  barrel vaulted copper and cedar shake roofing. Upon entry, its slate staircase
  and glass elevator provide the first hint of the superb mountain contemporary
  finishes found throughout. A frosted glass flooring from a hallway above
  streams light to the entry level. White hard maples, integrated color
  concrete, stainless steel interior sliding glass doors are but a few of the
  fine finishes utilized throughout. Located with end of the road privacy.
