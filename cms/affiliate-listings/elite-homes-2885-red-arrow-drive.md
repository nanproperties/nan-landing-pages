f_description: >-
  Situated against the foothills of Las Vegas' Red Rock Canyon National Park,
  this 5-bedroom estate built by Leroy Loerwald is located in the premier,
  double guard-gated community of Red Rock Country Club. Meticulously designed
  landscaping surrounds a wide stone walkway leading to the impressive two-story
  grand portico. Travertine floors, a beautiful wrought-iron spiraling
  staircase, and high ceilings with crown molding greet you at the front entry,
  along with an open floor plan that allows for mountain and golf course views
  from large windows and glass doors showcasing the main back patio. The home
  offers both style and comfort in its bright, airy spaces filled with exquisite
  premium finishes like the family room's built-in entertainment center and the
  large stone fireplace in the main living area. Being so close to Red Rock
  Canyon, yet near the city, you may be surprised to see the occasional wildlife
  criss-crossing your property
