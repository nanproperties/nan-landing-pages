f_description: >-
  Located on one of Austin’s most desirable streets, this stunning Meadowbank
  home is sited on a peaceful lagoon just across from Mayfield Park and Laguna
  Gloria. While just minutes from downtown, the atmosphere is one of peace and
  tranquility, quiet enough to attract wildlife including swans, cormorants,
  herons and more. The one half + acre lot features 150 +/- feet of waterfront
  with a perfect dock and boathouse; truly a kayaker’s or fisherman’s paradise.
  Two boat slips to house your watercraft for a spin on the main body of Lake
  Austin. This amazing property is currently on the market for $19,500,000.
