  Breathtaking helicopter views of the Manhattan skyline, Central Park, the East
  and Hudson Rivers and beyond define this sky-high penthouse duplex. With 9,000
  square feet, five bedrooms, and six-and-a-half bathrooms by architectural
  legend Charles Gwathmey, this palatial home features an awe-inspiring, 24-foot
  double-height ceiling in the living room, a chef's eat-in-kitchen with
  state-of-the-art stainless steel appliances, separate floors for entertaining
  and living, and a nearly 2,000-square-foot master suite with dual closets and
  separate bathrooms. Double home offices, a media room, two living rooms, and
  separate staff quarters and storage complete the property. Soaring over 700
  feet above midtown, PH51/52W offers views for miles, taking in landmarks and
  scenery rare in the current market and at this price per square foot. Through
  400 linear feet of 12-foot-high windows showcasing northern, western, and
  southern exposures, open vistas span from the East River to the Hudson and
  from the Freedom Tower to the George Washington Bridge. Currently on the
  market for $34,000,000, this high-rise is unlike anything else on the market.
