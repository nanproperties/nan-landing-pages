f_description: >-
  Centrally located along the I-5 corridor, between the San Francisco Bay Area
  and the Pacific Northwest metropolitan areas of Portland and Seattle, this
  spectacular one-of-a-kind home, on 700 awe-inspiring acres, offers magnificent
  sanctuary and adventure, as well as convenience. One of the most naturally
  beautiful regions of the country, this area of southern Oregon is known for a
  developing wine industry and phenomenal outdoor recreation opportunities.
  Characterized by four distinct seasons and mild winters, the climate is one of
  the most sought-after in North America. Designed to reflect and honor the
  majesty of this natural environment, this home sits on a high bench with open
  terraces that bring the view so close, you feel like you could reach out and
  touch it. Unique features like all rounded corners and smooth edges, a
  perfectly balanced use of the natural elements, and purposeful architectural
  design, create a remarkable effect, both peaceful and expansive. This home is
  beyond custom: it is a work of art. This property is listed at $6,000,000 and
  is an unparalleled place to rejuvenate and become inspired.
