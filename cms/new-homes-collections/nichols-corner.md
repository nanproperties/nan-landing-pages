f_description: >-
  With its close proximity to downtown Houston's Minute Maid Park, restaurants
  and entertainment, this beautiful new community is an ideal place to live. The
  development consists of two modern, trend-setting homes, each with three
  well-appointed bedrooms, 2Â½ bathrooms and a vast array of custom finishes to
  ensure your comfort. The homes also offer some very nice amenities: proximity
  to a lovely family park and the convenience of being minutes away from major
  roadways such as Highway 59, I-69 and 59 Connector.
